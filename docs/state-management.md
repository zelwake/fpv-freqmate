# State Management

## TanStack Query

- Use TanStack Query for server state and async data
- Follow TanStack Query best practices (enabled in ESLint)

## React Hooks

- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for local component state
- Custom hooks go in `hooks/` directory

## App-Wide State

- Consider React Context for app-wide state if needed
- Evaluate if TanStack Query can handle the use case first
